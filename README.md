##Repository with sources for the IV122 class @ FI MU Brno

Currently the docs pages are in the development. 

As there is no jar archive built yet, one does need to download 2 external dependencies and pack them to the project. The dependencies are:
  + jcommon-1.0.24
  + jfreechart-1.0.19
  
Both of the dependencies could be found at mvnrepository.

###I am using the Kotlin programming language, so you may need to download and add it as dependency as well.
